Connection string to interchange data
2 Approches
mysqli and pdo(php data object)
pdo is a advance approach as it can work with 12 drivers

constructor contain data member and member function

pdo Constructor required
server,user,password (parameters value required)

we use locallay here thats why we use root in user and null in password
if we use any domain then we put user name and password which provide by domain 

new keyword allocat space in memory when object is created

Query.php is used to interchange between databse and website

name key : predined name othati hai

built in method 
query: tab use karain gai fetch the whole data (like from table)
prepare: tab use karain when we want to fetch data from one row/condition exist (where clause exist) or want to fetch single string 
insert/delete/update/where use prepare

Session Variables

Sessions:
Http and https are state less . They don't maintain states when redirect to second page

when we start session an empty file is created on server and system

Definition:
if we want to maintain variables states in server we use seesions.
if we want to maintain variables states in website we use cookies.

static keyword:
we use to main state of files on file we use static keyword .
